# Clues and Required API Information:

## 1. Pandas DataFrame Operations:
- Use pd.read_csv() to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
- Use df.drop_duplicates() to remove duplicate rows.
- Use df.dropna() to remove rows with missing values.
- Use df.groupby() to group data by a specific column.
- Use df.sum() to calculate the sum of values in a DataFrame or Series.

# 2. Numpy Array Operations:
- Use np.array() to create a numpy array from a list or other sequence.
- Use np.sum() to calculate the sum of array elements.

# 3. Additional Tips:
- Remember to handle data types appropriately (e.g., converting strings to dates or numbers).
- Pay attention to column names and use df.rename() if necessary.
- Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks and tackle them one by one.
- Test your functions with sample data to ensure they work correctly.

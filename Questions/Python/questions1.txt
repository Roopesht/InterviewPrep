# How .env files make in to production?
Below script will read the contents of your .env file and set each variable as an environment variable in your Ubuntu environment.

#!/bin/bash

# Define your .env file path
ENV_FILE="/path/to/your/.env"

# Check if the .env file exists
if [ -f "$ENV_FILE" ]; then
    # Read the .env file line by line
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        # Skip empty lines and comments
        if [ -n "$line" ] && [[ "$line" != \#* ]]; then
            # Split the line into variable name and value
            key="${line%%=*}"
            value="${line#*=}"
            # Set the environment variable
            export "$key"="$value"
            echo "Exported environment variable: $key"
        fi
    done < "$ENV_FILE"
    echo "Environment variables set successfully."
else
    echo "The .env file does not exist."
    exit 1
fi
